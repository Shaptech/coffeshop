          A Legacy of Love and Baking Our bakery was founded by Precious, a

          Growing up in a family of avid bakers, Precious learned the secrets of
          traditional baking from a young age and went on to hone their skills
          in some of the world's top bakeries.

          established JBS with the goal of creating a world-class bakery that
          would become a beloved institution in the community. Today, we're
          proud to be a part of this vibrant community, serving up freshly baked
          goods that bring joy to our customers.
